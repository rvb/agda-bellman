# Provably-optimal solutions of deterministic sequential decision problems in Agda

This repo contains an Agda version of Ionescu et al's work on sequential decision problems (https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/sequential-decision-problems-dependently-typed-solutions(d15eaf67-5933-41d9-a0ec-6277b6e91d56).html) .
The implementation follows the structure described in the paper.
Any awkwardness or error in the implementation is mine rather than the paper authors'.

## Future Work

Currently, this repo does not include any examples, only the proof that given a maximiser, we can construct an optimal extension.
It also does not include Botta et al's follow-up work on problems with monadic transitions (e.g. stochastic ones) (https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutput/sequential-decision-problems-dependent-types-and-generic-solutions(ad0d5fc7-c663-4247-ae3e-1fb18b9608a4).html)
